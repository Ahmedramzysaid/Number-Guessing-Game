# Number Guessing Game

This Python script implements a number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The game keeps track of the player's attempts and provides feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. It also tracks the player's best score (fewest attempts).

## How to Play

1.  **Run the script:** Execute the Python script.  You'll typically do this from your computer's terminal or command prompt by navigating to the directory where you saved the script and then typing `python Guessing_Game.py` (assuming your script is named `Guessing_Game.py`).

2.  **Enter your name:** The game will start by asking you to type in your name and press Enter.

3.  **Choose to play:** The game will then ask if you want to play.  Type "Yes" or "No" (or "yes" or "no" â€“ the game accepts either) and press Enter.

4.  **Guess the number:** If you typed "Yes", the game will generate a secret number between 1 and 10. You'll be prompted to enter your guess. Type a number between 1 and 10 and press Enter.

5.  **Receive feedback:** The game will tell you if your guess is too high ("Your guess is bigger than number game") or too low ("Your guess is lower than number game").

6.  **Repeat:** Keep guessing until you guess the correct number.

7.  **Play again:** Once you guess the correct number, the game will congratulate you and show you how many attempts it took. It will then ask if you want to play again.  Type "Yes" to play another round with a new secret number, or "No" to finish.

8.  **View best score:** If you type "No", the game will display your best score, which is the fewest number of attempts you've taken to guess the correct number across all the games you've played.  Then the game will end.

**(Optional) Running from a specific directory:**

If your files are in a specific location, you'll need to navigate to that directory in your terminal or command prompt before running the script. Here's how:

*   **Windows:** Use the `cd` command. For example: `cd C:\path\to\your\files`
*   **macOS/Linux:** Use the `cd` command. For example: `cd /path/to/your/files`

Then, you can run the script as described in step 1.
